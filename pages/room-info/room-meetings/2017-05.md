### Resolutions

#### 1. [Suggested edits queue is full, Time to take a Stand?](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/108179/conversation/2017-may-topic-1)

No need to intervene, let Stack Overflow solve their UX issues. No strong opposition to reviewing the queue in the room, as has been done in the past.

#### 2. [When are too many cv-pls, too many?](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/108179/conversation/2017-may-topic-2)

Keep the current guidelines of not posting walls of requests (max 4 or 5 in a row), remind regulars to review.

#### 3. [Are proofread requests allowed?](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/108179/conversation/2017-may-topic-3)

Those requests are tolerated, however it would be better to host such activities outside of SOCVR (GitHub Gist or another chatroom).

#### 4. [Remove link to user in cv-pls request](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/108179/conversation/2017-may-topic-4)

While no ones sees any issue in itself in removing the link, there has been concern expressed on how some policies (mainly the no-harassment one) can be difficult to follow, even by well-meaning regulars. This should further be discussed and clarified.

#### 5. [Queen is breaking all our trains... How much can we take?](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/108179/conversation/2017-may-topic-5)

We should ask bot authors to make sure their code doesn't flood the room with messages and requests, possibly implementing batching or self-deletion. For now, regulars and ROs don't find the bots too noisy as they rarely ever interrupt a conversation.

#### 6. [Assign someone the job to update the content of SOCVR.org](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/108179/conversation/2017-may-topic-6)

It's been decided that we should leverage GitHub issues and simply communicate about them in the room.
