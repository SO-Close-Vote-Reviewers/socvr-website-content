5. Can we revisit a rule or FAQ about prescribed close reasons?


### Resolutions

#### 1. [SOCVR Sanitarium needs a better name](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/108179/conversation/2018-august-topic-1) <sub><sup>([GitHub issue](https://github.com/SO-Close-Vote-Reviewers/room-meeting-topics/issues/17))</sup><sub>

The name "SOCVR /dev/null" was chosen. The room has been renamed.

#### 2. [Do we need 'Do not request action on a post that you have asked or answered, or for an edit which you have made'?](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/108179/conversation/2018-august-topic-2) <sub><sup>([GitHub issue](https://github.com/SO-Close-Vote-Reviewers/room-meeting-topics/issues/18))</sup><sub>

There was considerable discussion. In fact, the topic of the discussion spread out to cover some other aspects of the request rules. The intent of the (above) rule which was primarily under discussion is that users should not abuse SOCVR requests to gain an advantage for themselves (e.g. get more votes for their posts, prevent competing answers, etc.). In addition to not actually gaining advantage, there should not even be the *appearance* of gaining advantage from requests. We do not want SOCVR to appear to be a voting ring.

The following specific cases were defined:

1. Don't `cv-pls` a question you have an answer on.
2. Don't `cv-pls` inactive questions.
3. Don't cause a question to be active (e.g. edit a post) to get around #2.
4. Don't `reopen-pls` your own questions. You may initiate a discussion as to should your own question remain closed, but don't make the discussion just a cover for requesting reopen-votes.

Other request types were not explicitly discussed.

#### 3. [Should we wait until after the grace period is over before posting a cv-pls request?](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/108179/conversation/2018-august-topic-3) <sub><sup>([GitHub issue](https://github.com/SO-Close-Vote-Reviewers/room-meeting-topics/issues/19))</sup><sub>

There is no requirement to wait. Use your best judgment. If the question OP is responsive, and it looks like the question will be improved, then think about waiting to post a `cv-pls` request.

Remember, the goal is good, on-topic questions.

Having a question be edited to be on-topic is something we *want* to have happen. When reviewing requests, if you see a question you feel has been edited into shape, mention it to (`@` ping) the person who requested it, so they can see if they want to withdraw their `cv-pls` request (and closevote). If the now on-topic question is already closed, then please post a `reopen-pls` request.

#### 4. [Should it be allowed to systematically target questions that are answered by a specific OP?](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/108179/conversation/2018-august-topic-4) <sub><sup>([GitHub issue](https://github.com/SO-Close-Vote-Reviewers/room-meeting-topics/issues/20))</sup><sub>

User targeting is not permitted, including making requests about questions because a specific user posted answers to those questions.

#### 5. [Can we revisit a rule or FAQ about prescribed close reasons?](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/108179/conversation/2018-august-topic-5) <sub><sup>([GitHub issue](https://github.com/SO-Close-Vote-Reviewers/room-meeting-topics/issues/21))</sup><sub>

* Be Nice. The [Code of Conduct](https://stackoverflow.com/conduct) (CoC) applies to all chat messages, including requests.
* If you see a request, or any message, that isn't within the CoC:
 * If within the 2 minute edit window, feel free to give the user a *friendly* reminder, asking them to edit/delete; and/or:
 * Anytime: ping an RO for removal, to handle repeat occurrences, etc.
* Beyond the CoC, requests should be business-like/professional.
* An actual close reason is highly recommended, even if that's your custom reason (e.g. "Custom: Homework without attempt"). Including an actual close reason will significantly increase the likelihood that your request will be acted upon by other users.
* Additional factual information in requests is fine, particularly when it's there to help other users save time in evaluating the post, or even to make the choice to click-through to the question.
  Examples:
  * "No MCVE: no code"
  * "Typo: see 5th line of 2nd code block foo should be bar. Confirmed by OP in comments."
